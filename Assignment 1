Saturday 2 to 5 CLASS 1 ASSIGNMENT

🔹 Prompt Engineering vs Context Engineering
Prompt Engineering: Creating clear and effective prompts to get the best AI response.
 Context Engineering: Giving background or extra info so AI fully understands the situation.
 Difference: Prompt focuses on question quality, context focuses on information clarity.
🔹 How They Work Together
Prompt tells what to do, and context tells why and how.
 Together, they make AI replies more accurate, relevant, and human-like.
 Good prompt + good context = best AI performance.
🔹 Temperature & Top-p
Temperature: Controls creativity (low = focused, high = creative).
 Top-p: Chooses words based on probability for balanced responses.
🔹 Zero-Shot Prompting (1 line)
AI answers without any example — depends only on the question.
🔹 One-Shot Prompting
AI gets one example before answering — helps guide its tone or format.
🔹 Few-Shot Prompting
AI learns from a few examples to understand the pattern and give better results.
🔹 System Prompting
It sets AI’s role or behavior (e.g., “You are a teacher” or “You are a doctor”).
 Defines style, tone, and focus of all replies.
🔹 Role Prompting
Tells AI what identity to take — makes replies more realistic and context-aware.
🔹 Contextual Prompting
Adds relevant background or user info so AI gives personalized and accurate answers.
